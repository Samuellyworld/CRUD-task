# CRUD-task

Live at - https://zuriteam-crud-task.herokuapp.com/  hosted on heroku.

I used a Mock Up test data for start but you can create yours with POSTMAN

using string as the schema for your POSTMAN JSON with whatever information you want in the value object for example:

```javascript
{ 
  "name" : "John",
  "email" : "John@gmail.com",
  "country" : "Canada"
 }
 ```
  
use POSTMAN for each end points

Get Data with - https://zuriteam-crud-task.herokuapp.com/data  with endpoint[GET] - this will get my mockup data if you haven't created data.

Create Data - https://zuriteam-crud-task.herokuapp.com/data with endpoint[POST] - this will create the user data.

Update data - https://zuriteam-crud-task.herokuapp.com/data/:dataId with endpoint [PUT] - with its data ID to update the user data.

Delete Data - https://zuriteam-crud-task.herokuapp.com/:dataId with endpoint [DELETE] - with its data ID to delete the user data.
